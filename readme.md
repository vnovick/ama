#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.
- Assign relevant [label](https://github.com/vnovick/ama/labels) to an issue

##### Answers from me

All questions are welcome, but not everyone will be answered because of time constraints. I welcome others to answer questions on the repo. To increase the likelyhood of me answering your question it should:

- Be relevant to me or my opinions in some way and not something anyone could answer (those are better served by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc).
- Be helpful or interesting for other people. Answers that only help the asker are not an efficient use of my time and may not be answered. 
- I will occasionally stream AMA on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vnovick) once I will have a list of questions to answer during 1h timeframe. These video answers will be usually uploaded to [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/VladimirNovickDev) and linked to the issues with answer timestamp.

##### Answer format

Some answers may be in the form of [audio clips](https://github.com/vnovick/ama/issues?q=label%3Aaudio-answer) or [videos](https://github.com/vnovick/ama/issues?q=label%3Avideo-answer). This is not meant to exclude anyone. I wouldn't have time to answer these questions at all otherwise. Anyone is welcome and encouraged to transcribe these answers and leave a comment so that everyone can benefit from the answers. 

#### Other contact mediums

I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vnovick) DMs, but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/vnovick/ama/issues/new).
